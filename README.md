N-Queens Problem Solver

Description

This Python script solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking approach. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

How It Works

The script implements the following functions:

verif_but(etat, n): Checks if a solution is complete by verifying if the length of the current state (etat) is equal to n.

est_valide(etat, colonne, ligne): Determines if a queen can be placed at a given column and row without conflicting with previously placed queens.

succ(etat, n): Generates valid successor states by adding a new queen to the current board configuration.

resolution(n): Recursively finds all possible solutions using a backtracking approach.

How to Run the Code

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Copy and paste the script into a Python file (e.g., n_queens.py).

Run the script using: python n_queens.py
The output will display the number of solutions and all valid board configurations.
Example Output :
Number of solutions for 8-Queens: 92
[0, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 3]
[0, 5, 7, 2, 6, 3, 1, 4]
...
Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is approximately O(N!) in the worst case, making it impractical for very large values of N.

Applications

AI and constraint satisfaction problems

Chess-related problem-solving

Algorithmic optimization and recursion learning

Notes

The algorithm may take longer for larger values of N due to the exponential growth of possibilities.

The current implementation finds all solutions, but can be modified to return only one solution if needed.
